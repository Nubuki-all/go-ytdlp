# TODO

- executable logic (Version(), Update(), etc)
- fix dump not always being executable (sometimes just a boolean flag)
- add IOTA for choices logic, and change function types
- some flags can be specified multiple times, which isn't currently supported (e.g. --downloader-args)
- add version of yt-dlp that export-options was ran with
- error wrapping
