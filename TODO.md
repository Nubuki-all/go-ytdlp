# TODO

- github actions job for re-generating when a new yt-dlp version is released (PR -> bump version number?)
- json representation with marshal/unmarshal
- http server endpoint generation
- get go-ytdlp added to <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#embedding-yt-dlp>?
- keep track of supported "%(<format>)s" options?
- PrintToFile (support json -> struct for this?)
- tests for Result and ResultLog
- internal json -> struct map (incl all our cleaned up fields), so we could export all options via graphql for go-ytdlp-web?
- <https://github.com/wader/goutubedl>
- support output multi-writer for custom user-defined writers
